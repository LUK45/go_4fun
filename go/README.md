## First task

John is a strawberry farmer. Each year he sells parts of his field
to customers to harvest, for a fixed price based on size of the part they asked for.
He used a simple deduction, where he assumed that all parts of the field
have the same yield. Year by a year, the number of his customers grew and John
began to question his deduction. Is he actually asking enough for the different
parts of his field? He started to mark yields of each and every part of the field.
Since his strawberry fields are huge, he is not able to calculate the yield
of different parts effectively and all by himself. He asked you to create an algorithm,
that will help him figure out the yields of different parts of the field that
the customers are asking for.

### Task definition

Your task is to write an algorithm that will help John calculate
yields of different parts of his field. You will receive size of his field,
yield for each part of his field and queries for each customer with part of the field
he wants to harvest. For each customer query, you should return the expected
yield for given part of the field. Expected yield is represented by a sum of
yields for given part of a field. The part customer asks for is always of
a rectangular shape.

As a part of your solution, you should explain the basic idea of your algorithm
along with the memory and time complexity of your solution. Focus on optimizing
query time.

### Input format

First row of input consists of 2 numbers, **N** - size of strawberry field,
which is always a square of size N*N,
and **Q** - numer of queries on input
Next **N** rows represent the strawberry field.
After that, **Q** rows follow, each cosisting of 4 integers
**a**, **b**, **c**, **d**, representing the part of field,
John wants to know the yield of.

### Constraints

- **N** will be between 3 and 10_000, inclusive.
- **Q** will be between 1 and 1_000_000, incluse.
- **a**, **b**, **c**, **d** will be less than or equal to **N**.
- **a** will be less than or equal to **c**
- **b** will be less than or equal to **d**

### Example

Input

```text
7 3
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
8 9 1 2 3 4 5
6 7 8 9 1 2 3
4 5 6 7 8 9 1
2 3 4 5 6 7 8
9 1 2 3 4 5 6
7 8 9 1 2 3 4
1 1 7 7
3 3 3 3
4 2 6 2
```

Output

```text
235
8
9
```

Since query _1 1 7 7_ represents the whole field,
result of the first query is the sum of the whole field, which is 235.
Second query represents an exact position of 3 3, and the yield on
that part of the field is 8.
The third query result is 9 since the yields in that part equal to 5, 3 and 1.

### Your solution description of first task

```
$ cat input | go run yields.go 
235
8
9
```

1) input is filled into two-dimenstional int array representing field
2) algorithm goes through all queries and counts sum of yields 
	* takes first and third parameter of query as rows
	* second and fourth parameter as columns
	* counts the sum of yields of rectangular defined by rows and columns

In worst case scenario time and space complexity is O(N^2)


## Second task

After John successfully evaluated the different yields of his field,
he now thinks about expanding his strawberry enterprise. He wants to
select the best spots around Slovakia to expand his business. Strawberries however
require specific temperature, so these spots needs to be selected very carefully.
John would like to automate the process of selecting the best spots, temperature
wise, but he's missing a key component - the temperature API.
The API should be able to list all the spots with recorded temperature and respond
to requests for specific spots. It should be also updated daily, so John always gets
the latest data.

### Task

Your task is to create a REST API to help John with his automation
and a scraper that will scrape the temperature data real-time.
You can find all necessary data on [this website](http://www.shmu.sk/sk/?page=1&id=meteo_num_alad&mesto=BRATISLAVA).
For the purpose of the task, you don't need to scrape the website daily, just create
an endpoint that will trigger the scraping when called - e.g. GET /api/temperature/scrape.
You can store the data however you like, there's no need for a real database.

The REST API should expose two routes

- `GET /api/temperature` - to list all the places with recorded temperature
- `GET /api/temperature/<identifier>` - to get the entry based on identifier

You are free to use any library you find suitable for the task.

### Example of the API

The structure could for example look like this (but you can do it any way you like)

```text
GET /api/temperature
Response
{
    "success": "true",
    "data": [
        {
            "id": "bratislava",
            "city": "Bratislava",
            "temperature": {
                "low": 19
                "high": 25
            }            
        },
        {
            "id": "trnava",
            "city": "Trnava",
            "temperature": {
                "low": 17
                "high": 24
            }
        }, ...
    ]
}
```

```text
GET /api/temperature/bratislava
Response
{
    "success": "true",
    "data": {
        "id": "bratislava",
        "city": "Bratislava",
        "temperature": {
            "low": 19
            "high": 25
        }
    }
}
```
